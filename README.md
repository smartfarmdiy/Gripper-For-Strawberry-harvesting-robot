# Gripper-For-Strawberry-harvesting-robot

I have designed a gripper to be mounted on a robot-arm on the strawberry harvesting robot. My gripper has 2 mechanisms: 1. a clamping mechanism for catching strawberries using SOFT-gripper  2. a scissor mechanism for cutting the stems of strawberries. My gripper uses Servo motors for all drives My model is in the development and fabrication phase. not yet completed
